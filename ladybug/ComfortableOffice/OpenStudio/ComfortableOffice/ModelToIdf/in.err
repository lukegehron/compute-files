   ** Warning ** The design coil load is zero for Coil:Heating:Water COIL HEATING WATER 2
   **   ~~~   ** The autosize value for maximum water flow rate is zero
   **   ~~~   ** To change this, input a value for UA, change the heating design day, or raise the
   **   ~~~   **   system heating design supply air temperature. Also check to make sure the Preheat
   **   ~~~   **   Design Temperature is not the same as the Central Heating Design Supply Air Temperature. 
   ** Severe  ** AirLoopHVAC DOAS AIR LOOP HVAC1 has no air flow
   **   ~~~   ** Check flow rate inputs for components in this air loop and,
   **   ~~~   ** if autosized, check Sizing:Zone and Sizing:System objects and related inputs.
   **  Fatal  ** Previous condition causes termination.
